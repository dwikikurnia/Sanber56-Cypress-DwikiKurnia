# Documentation for add-products-negative.cy.js
    
    ## Overview:
This JavaScript code snippet is written using Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications. This script tests the functionality of adding a product to the shopping cart and performing the checkout on an eCommerce website and ensures error messages are properly displayed when applying invalid actions.

## Detailed Function Descriptions:

1. `require`: It is a built-in function in Node.js, which is used to include modules that exist in separate files. In this case, it is used to include `user.json` file located in the 'fixtures' directory.

2. `describe`: This function is utilized for grouping related tests. The string "Add Product & Checkout Feature" describes the test suite (group of related tests).

3. `beforeEach`: This function is a type of hook. The beforeEach hook runs a certain piece of code before each test in the current suite ("Add Product & Checkout Feature").

4. `it`: This function signifies an individual test. The string argument "Show error when updating cart with empty quantity" is a description of the test.

5. `cy.visit`: This function orders Cypress to navigate to the specified URL.

6. `cy.get`: This function retrieves a DOM element.

7. `cy.click`: This function simulates a click event on a DOM element.

8. `cy.should`: This function asserts that the previously retrieved DOM element should have a certain state, or triggers a callback function to make an assertion.

9. `cy.clear`: This function clears the value of the DOM input field.

10. `cy.type`: This function types into a DOM element with the provided text.

## Function Parameters and Return Values:
There are predefined functions used in this code snippet which are provided by Cypress, and the parameters and return values follow Cypress's definitions, as follows:

- Cypress `describe` function, `it` function, and hooks (`beforeEach`) all do not return values. They rather take callback functions as arguments to create or control the execution flow of test cases. 

- `cy.visit`, `cy.get`, `cy.click`, `cy.clear`, & `cy.type` all return `cy` which is a representation of the element in the document.

- `cy.should` would also return `cy` unless it was given a callback, in which case it acts as an assertion.


## Usage Examples: 

- The `require` function is being used to include the `user.json` file. So, if the `user.json` file is saved under the 'fixtures' folder, it can be made available to current script by calling `require("../../fixtures/user.json")`. This file, in common scenarios, will contain default data to be used for testing.

- The commands `cy.visit("/")` and `cy.visit("/push-it-messenger-bag.html")` gets Cypress to navigate to default URL and '/push-it-messenger-bag.html' endpoint respectively. 

- `cy.get('button[title="Add to Cart"]').click()` finds the button with title 'Add to Cart' and simulates click event on the identified HTML button element.
  
- `cy.get(".message-success").should("contain", "You added")` verifies if the `.message-success` element contains the text "You added".

- `cy.get("input.input-text.qty").clear().type("invalid")` finds an input field with class names 'input-text' and 'qty', then clears the field and types "invalid".

- `cy.get(".mage-error").should("contain", "This is a required field.")` verifies if the `.mage-error` element contains the text "This is a required field". This example illustrates the common usage of using Cypress for testing validations.
